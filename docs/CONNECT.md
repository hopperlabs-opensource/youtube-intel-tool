## Current Best Contact Path

- Open a GitHub Issue for bugs and feature requests.
- Open a GitHub Discussion for governance/maintainer questions.
- Use the security policy process for private vulnerability reports:
  [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/hopperlabs-opensource/youtube-intel-tool/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Support Setup Notes

- `Sponsor` button support is managed via
  [`.github/FUNDING.yml`](https://github.com/hopperlabs-opensource/youtube-intel-tool/blob/main/.github/FUNDING.yml).
- Keep Patreon disabled in that file until the official handle is created.
- Prefer a dedicated role alias email (for example `oss@...`) over personal
  email before publishing a direct contact address.

## Safety Note

Never share API keys, tokens, or private logs in public issues, discussions, or
social posts.
